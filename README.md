# iTC Reporter

## What?
This script mimics the official **App Store Connect Reporter** by Apple which is used to automatically **retrieve Sales- and Financial Reports** for your App Store sales.
It is written in pure Python and **doesn't need a Java runtime installation**.
Opposed to Apple's tool, it can fetch App Store Connect login credentials from the macOS Keychain in order to **tighten security** a bit. Also, it goes the extra mile and **unzips the downloaded reports**.

Before Apple in 2018 decided to rebrand it, App Store Connect used to be called iTunes Connect or iTC in short – hence the name of this script.

## Why?

### Once upon a time, there was autoingestion …
In the past, Apple has provided a tool called **autoingest** for automated retrieving of sales reports from App Store Connect. While this tool worked quite reliably, it needed a full blown Java Runtime Environment installed.

### … nowadays, it's all about Reporter
Apple has shut down autoingestion on December 13th, 2016. Fortunately, it has been replaced by a new and a bit more streamlined tool called **Reporter**. Unfortunately, **Reporter** is based on Java, too. It also suffers from a minor but annoying security threat as it needs to read App Store Connect login credentials from a cleartext file.

### Java really is a sledge hammer to crack this nut
There really is no compelling reason to employ a Java tool with its somewhat heavyweight dependency on JRE in order to download a few reports from App Store Connect. Apart from the Apple backend engineering staff really being into Java, apparently. Also, storing login credentials in cleartext isn't state of the art anymore.

**iTC Reporter** (this Python script), on the other hand, solves both problems. It is written in pure Python and doesn't need Java or any external dependencies to function. Also, it can optionally read the App Store Connect access token from the macOS Keychain (though it generally is still advisable to use an extra Apple ID specifically created for retrieving reports!).

## How?

The argument names and values of this script have mostly been chosen to be consistent with [Apple's documentation for Reporter](https://help.apple.com/itc/appsreporterguide/). To get a quick overview, here is the output of `./reporter.py -h`: 
```text

### Prerequisites

#### Creating an app-specific password

Assuming you are using two-factor authentication (2FA) with your Apple ID, you need to create an app-specific password for `reporter.py` by following [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397).

#### Obtaining an App Store Connect access token
Since end of July 2017, Apple requires the use of access tokens instead of passwords for **Reporter**. To generate an access token for an Apple ID, log in to App Store Connect using the Apple ID that you plan to use with `reporter.py`. Go to *Sales and Trends > Saved > [Sales and Trends - Reports](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/trends/reports)*, then click on the help icon next to *About Reports*. Click *Generate Access Token*. 

Or, instead of doing these steps manually, you can just let `reporter.py` fetch a token for you from App Store Connect. In addition, let's conveniently store it for future use in the macOS Keychain as an item named "iTC Access Token":

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com generateToken -P <AppSpecificPassword> --update-keychain-item "iTC Access Token"

Your new access token has been generated.
AccessToken:4fbd6016-439d-4cef-a72e-5c465f8343d4
Expiration Date:2024-01-27
Keychain has been updated.
```

#### Storing credentials securely with Keychain

As access tokens expire after 180 days it probably is desirable to make the process of getting a new one automatable. But what about the cleartext app-specific password following the -P parameter? It definitely should be fetched from Keychain, too, instead of having to pass it on the command line! To accomplish this, you need to manually create a keychain item holding your password. To do so, open the Keychain Access.app, select the default keychain, press ⌘N and fill in the app-specific password. The item name you set for this new keychain entry is going to be what you have to supply for the `-p` (now lowercase!) parameter from now on. The command for obtaining a new access token now looks like this:

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com generateToken -p "iTC App-Specific Password" --update-keychain-item "iTC Access Token"
```

**Please note:** Refreshing your access token using this command is only necessary after expiration (usually meaning every 180 days)! You can check for expiration with the `viewToken` command.

### Usage examples

You are now equipped for regular use of this script by supplying your access token with the `-t` parameter. The following example queries App Store Connect's availability status for financial reports while fetching the access token from the Keychain item named "iTC Access Token":

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com getStatus Finance -t "iTC Access Token"
```

#### Querying accessible accounts
Because your Apple ID could have access to multiple accounts, you will sometimes need to specify the account number you’d like to use. Use the following query to find out which accounts are available:

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com getAccounts Sales -t "iTC Access Token"
```
The result is a list of account numbers you can then specify with the `-a` or `--account` argument in later queries regarding sales reports. Similarly, you'd use `getAccounts Finance` in order to find out account numbers that can be used for financial report queries.

#### Retrieving reports
Let's get to the point of this tool now: Retrieving reports from App Store Connect.
To find out which vendor numbers you can query, you'll first need to get a list of available vendors, using (one of) the account number(s) you have found out with `getAccounts` before:

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com --account 2821955 getVendors -t "iTC Access Token"
```

The resulting vendor number(s) can then be used to get the actual reports. In the following example, a sales report listing the sales of a single day (2023/07/18) for vendor 85442109 is going to be retrieved: 

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com -a 2821955 getSalesReport 85442109 Daily 20230718 -t "iTC Access Token"
```

Likewise, the following example fetches a financial report for sales in the US region in the first period of 2023 (according to Apple's fiscal calendar):

```sh
./reporter.py -u your@apple-id.com -a 2821955 getFinancialReport 85442109 US 2023 01 -t "iTC Access Token"
```

These examples should do for a quick introduction. Don't forget to read Apple's [reference documentation](https://help.apple.com/itc/appsreporterguide/) for **Reporter**. Also, you can get further help for a specific command by supplying `-h` after the command's name. For example: 

```sh
./reporter.py getFinancialReport -h
```

## What's still missing
There seem to be [additional report types](https://help.apple.com/itc/contentreporterguide/en.lproj/static.html) available for retrieving Apple Music and Apple Podcasts related data, but I wonder if anybody using this script would really need it.

## Obligatory disclaimer

There is absolutely no warranty. I do not guarantee in any way that this tool works as intended or is fully compatible with Apple's official **Reporter** tool.
